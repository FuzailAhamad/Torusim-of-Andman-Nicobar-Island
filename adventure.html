            <h5>Scuba diving</h5>
            <p>Don’t know how to swim? No need! Many people feel that they should be a pro in swimming before going for scuba diving. But the reality is different. You need swimming skills only when you want to go into the open waters and try the challenging levels.  <br><br>
     
    
                But you can still start small and discover vivid marine life and corals because there are different places for scuba diving and activities like Sea Walking or PADI Scuba Diving.  </p>

                <h5>Banana Ride</h5>
                <p> Banana boat ride is like regular boating except for the fact that the boats are shaped like bananas and are tied with speed boats from the front. The speed boats provide momentum to the banana boats. Hence, the boats move at a very high speed, which is quite a thrilling experience for the riders. <br>

                    At a single time, a total of 6 people can ride on these boats. An instructor and guide will be present on the boat for assistance. You need to put on life jackets for the same and there is nothing to worry about. <br><br>
                    
                     
                    
                    Another water activity which is splendidly fun is a banana boat ride. It’s a banana shaped boat and six people can sit in it at the same time. You’ll have an instructor accompanying you and you need not worry as there will be life jackets too.</p>
